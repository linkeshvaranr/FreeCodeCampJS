### 2. Check the given string is palindrome or not

+ Using regex remove white spaces and char
+ Using array methods split , reverse and join reverse the string
+ compare two strings and return the boolean value

### 3. Caesa Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

#### Here in ROT13 the char are replaced with char that are 13 more
#### I just used two arrays that are matched opposite to each other and check using equality operator
#### finally pushed the matched char to an array
